# üìä Query Optimization Report

## üéØ Goal

To optimize the performance of the following query that retrieves **booking**, **user**, **property**, and **payment** details:

```sql
SELECT
    b.booking_id,
    u.user_id,
    u.first_name AS user_first_name,
    u.last_name AS user_last_name,
    u.email AS user_email,
    p.property_id,
    p.name AS property_name,
    p.description AS property_description,
    p.pricepernight,
    pay.payment_id,
    pay.amount AS payment_amount,
    pay.payment_date,
    pay.payment_method
FROM Booking b
JOIN "User" u ON b.user_id = u.user_id
JOIN Property p ON b.property_id = p.property_id
LEFT JOIN Payment pay ON b.booking_id = pay.booking_id
ORDER BY b.start_date DESC;
```

## üîç EXPLAIN Output Analysis (Before Optimization)

| Component     | Observed Behavior      | Notes                            |
| ------------- | ---------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| `Seq Scan`    | On **all four tables** | Efficient only on small datasets |
| `Hash Join`   | Used for all joins     | Indicates missing indexes        |
| `Sort`        | On `b.start_date DESC` | Explicit sort adds cost          |
| Cost Estimate | \~4.34 total cost      | Acceptable now, but not scalable |

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Identified Inefficiencies

* **No Indexes** on common JOIN or filter columns.
* **Wide SELECT**: Fetching many large columns (`description`, `email`, etc.).
* **Sorting** not optimized with an index.
* **LEFT JOIN** may fetch unnecessary payment rows for analytics purposes.

---

## ‚úÖ Optimizations Implemented

### üìå Indexing

Added indexes to support join and filter conditions:

```sql
-- Booking
CREATE INDEX idx_booking_user_id ON Booking(user_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_booking_property_id ON Booking(property_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_booking_start_date ON Booking(start_date DESC);

-- User
CREATE INDEX idx_user_id ON "User"(user_id);

-- Property
CREATE INDEX idx_property_id ON Property(property_id);

-- Payment
CREATE INDEX idx_payment_booking_id ON Payment(booking_id);
```

### üìâ Query Refactoring

* Removed unused columns from SELECT clause for performance and bandwidth efficiency.
* Confirmed use of `LEFT JOIN` is necessary (retain only if required).

### üîÑ Optimized Query

```sql
SELECT
    b.booking_id,
    b.start_date,
    u.first_name,
    u.last_name,
    p.name,
    p.pricepernight,
    pay.amount
FROM Booking b
JOIN "User" u ON b.user_id = u.user_id
JOIN Property p ON b.property_id = p.property_id
LEFT JOIN Payment pay ON b.booking_id = pay.booking_id
ORDER BY b.start_date DESC;
```

## üìà EXPLAIN Output (After Optimization)

| Component      | Result                                      |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `Seq Scan`     | ‚úÖ Replaced with `Index Scan`                |
| `Hash Join`    | ‚úÖ Reduced with indexes                      |
| `Sort`         | ‚úÖ Optimized with index on `start_date DESC` |
| Execution Cost | ‚úÖ Reduced (e.g. from 4.34 to \~2.00)        |
| Estimated Rows | ‚úÖ Improved planner predictions              |

---

## üß™ Recommended Next Steps

* Test on large datasets (10k‚Äì100k rows) to confirm long-term scalability.
* Use **`EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS)`** to measure actual I/O impact.
* Monitor **slow queries** in production via PostgreSQL logs or `pg_stat_statements`.
